# Highly Available Multi-Region WordPress Cluster

Out-of-the-Box Enterprise WordPress Cluster with extra High Availability that can withstand to even cloud datacentre failure

## Cluster Components

Upon the package installation, new environments will be created, one environment per one [Region](https://docs.jelastic.com/environment-regions). Number of Regions may vary between 3 and 5.

Each environment comprises the software stacks as follows:  

  - **Load balancer**: highly available and high-performance **[LiteSpeed ADC](https://docs.jelastic.com/litespeed-web-adc)** which is used for distributing the incoming traffic within a one region  
  
  - **Application server**: highly available and  high-performance **[LiteSpeed Web Server](https://docs.jelastic.com/litespeed-web-server)** the WordPress software runs on. Web servers come with preconfigured **[automatic horizontal scaling](https://docs.jelastic.com/automatic-horizontal-scaling)** to handle load spikes
  
  - **Caching solution**: highly available and high-performance **[Redis](https://docs.jelastic.com/redis/)** object caching storage.  It stores in memory the database query results that have been loaded

  - **Database**:Highly-available **[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)** cluster is used to store and operate user data   

  - **Storage**: **[Shared Storage](https://docs.jelastic.com/shared-storage-container)** cluster, ensuring high availablity with GlusterFS, is mounted to all application server nodes for sharing common data

If you are already registered at Jelastic, you can deploy this cluster by importing the  [the package manifest raw link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jelastic-jps/wordpress-multiregions/master/manifest.yml) within the dashboard.
 
## Installation Process

In the opened confirmation window at Jelastic dashboard, choose:  

* destination **Regions**. The first chosen Region will be acting as **Primary**   

* **Environment Name**

* preconfigured horizontal **Scaling Strategy**   

* **Database Topology** depending on connection latency value between Regions. In case latency is less than 20 ms we recommend to use **[Sync Galera Distribution](https://jelastic.com/blog/mariadb-galera-cluster-replication/)**, otherwise use **[Async Primary/Replica Distribution](https://jelastic.com/blog/master-master-slave-replication-mysql-mariadb-auto-clustering/)**. This option will affect the whole solution topology:

    * Sync Galera

* **WordPress Brute Force Attack Protection** option will protect WordPress admin panel  

* **Web Application Firewall** secure feature that comes with Layer-7 Anti-DDoS Filtering as well as IP level bandwidth and request rate throttling. It won't degrade the LSADC performance since it can be tuned to withstand dynamic requests only.
 
* Traffic encryption is provided by **[Let's Encrypt Add-On](https://jelastic.com/blog/free-ssl-certificates-with-lets-encrypt/)**  with automatic issuing of trusted SSL certificate and Auto-Renewal

* **[Premium CDN](https://jelastic.com/blog/enterprise-cdn-verizon-integration/)** integration in order to provide Lightning-fast static assets loading  

Finally click on **Install**
